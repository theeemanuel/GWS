# GWS (Gravitational Wave Source)
<br />
_class_ __GWS__ is a dummy parent class <br />
<br />
*class* **UnitGWS** is for injecting Source Properties of Single Rotating GWS with methods: <br />
**GWpower** for extracting GW power radiated from the source. <br />
**optimalStrain** for extracting optimal strain amplitude from the source. <br />
**strain** for extracting strain amplitude for +-polarisation and x-polarisation from the source. <br />
