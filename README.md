# GWS (Gravitational Wave Source)

*class* **GWS** is a dummy parent class

*class* **UnitGWS** is for injecting Source Properties of Single Rotating GWS with methods:
**GWpower** for extracting GW power radiated from the source.
**optimalStrain** for extracting optimal strain amplitude from the source.
**strain** for extracting strain amplitude for +-polarisation and x-polarisation from the source.
