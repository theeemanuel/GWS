# GWS (Gravitational Wave Source)
<br />
<i>class</i> <b>GWS</b> is a dummy parent class <br />
<br />
<i>class</i> <b>UnitGWS</b> is for injecting Source Properties of Single Rotating GWS with methods: <br />
<b>GWpower</b> for extracting GW power radiated from the source. <br />
  <b>optimalStrain</b> for extracting optimal strain amplitude from the source. <br />
  <b>strain</b> for extracting strain amplitude for +-polarisation and x-polarisation from the source. <br />
